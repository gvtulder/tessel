<h3>Up for a challenge?</h3>
<p>
  Played the triangles and squares? Try some of the other shapes and tiling patterns in a <a data-internal="setup" href="#setup">custom game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Want to mix things up? Change the rules; require that colors should not match, or use only tiles with unique colors.
</p>
<p>
  Note: some combinations may make it impossible to make a valid tiling! The game will warn you if that happens.
