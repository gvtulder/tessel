<h3>How to play?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drag a tile from the stack to place it on the board. Click&nbsp;a tile to
    rotate.
  </li>
  <li>The colors must match with the other tiles.</li>
  <li>
    Make a closed shape of a single color to earn points. The&nbsp;larger the
    shape, the higher the points.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The game ends when you have placed all tiles.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul class="options">
  <li data-setting="color-scheme">
    Light mode, dark&nbsp;mode,<br />or follow your device.
  </li>
  <li data-setting="placeholders">Show placeholder tiles</li>
  <li data-setting="hints">Show valid tile positions</li>
  <li data-setting="autorotate">Automatically rotate tiles</li>
  <li data-setting="snap">Snap tiles into place</li>
</ul>

<h3>Up for a challenge?</h3>
<p>
  Once youâ€™ve played triangles and squares, try some of the other shapes and
  tiling patterns in a <a data-internal="setup" href="#setup">custom game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you want, you can even change the rules: require non-matching colors, or
  use only tiles with unique colors.
</p>
<p>
  Note: some combinations may lead to an impossible tilings! The game will warn
  you if this is the case.
