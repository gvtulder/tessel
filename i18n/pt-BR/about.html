<h3>Como jogar?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Arraste uma peça da pilha para colocá-la no tabuleiro. Clique em uma peça para girá-la.
  </li>
  <li>Combine as cores com as peças ao lado.</li>
  <li>
    Complete a closed shape of one color to earn points. The bigger the shape, the higher the points.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The game ends when you have placed all your tiles.</p>

<h3>Up for a challenge?</h3>
<p>
  Played the triangles and squares? Try some of the other shapes and tiling patterns in a <a href="{setup}">custom game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Want to mix things up? Change the rules; require that colors should not match, or use only tiles with unique colors.
</p>
<p>
  Note: some combinations may make it impossible to make a valid tiling! The game will warn you if that happens.
