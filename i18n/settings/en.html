<h3>How to play?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drag a tile from the stack to place it on the board. Click&nbsp;on a tile to
    rotate it.
  </li>
  <li>Match the colors with the tiles next to it.</li>
  <li>
    Complete a closed shape of one color to earn points. The&nbsp;bigger the
    shape, the higher the points.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The game ends when you have placed all your tiles.</p>

<h3>Up for a challenge?</h3>
<p>
  Played the triangles and squares? Try some of the other shapes and tiling
  patterns in a <a data-internal="setup" href="#setup">custom game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Want to mix things up? Change the rules; require that colors should not match,
  or use only tiles with unique colors.
</p>
<p>
  Note: some combinations may make it impossible to make a valid tiling! The
  game will warn you if that happens.
